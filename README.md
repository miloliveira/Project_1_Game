# Project_1_Game

## _"Grandma Attacks"_


### Misson :rocket: 

_Grandma Attacks_ is the Project 1 of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.

The mission was to create a game using the tools we had learned in the first 2 weeks of the bootcamp. 


### Idea :older_woman: 

The idea was based in the fact that all my life, I heard my grandmother telling me that I was to thin, while she was giving me food. 
I know for a fact that it is not just my grandmother that does that, so that was the main inspiration to create the game.


### Goal :checkered_flag:

The goal is for the player to avoid the food _grandma_ is throwing at him/her, until _grandma_ gets to tired. Meanwhile, the player must pick up as much coins as possible, to ensure his/her financially independence in the future. 
Besides, some life bonus appears in the canvas if the player's life is to low.


## Controls :clipboard:

The player must use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the character, finish his/her mission and win the game.
